## About
This was developed during Bootcamp Week 15, our 'break week' between the front end BadBank Project and the final trimester where we dive in to the back-end.  

I wanted to get some preliminary exposure to MongoDB and express, so I built and deployed this full stack MERN App following Traversy Media's YouTube Playlist: [Learn the MERN Stack](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbQeVSccR9PGKHzPJSWqcsm).


## How to Run
>Heroku Deployment

This app is deployed to Heroku, please be patient as it spins up.

>Login / Create Account

This app uses JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users.

>Goals

Create goals for users to track, and delete.

## Future Roadmap
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated.
